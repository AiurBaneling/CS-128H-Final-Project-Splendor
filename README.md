# CS-128H-Final-Project-Splendor
A rust program that imitate the play of the board game splendor

This project is my work for CS 128 honor section final project. I plan to create a program that allows people to play the board game splendor on the computer. It's quite painful to carry the whole board game around, especially when you are travelling. So this program would be quite beneficial (at least for me and my friends).
